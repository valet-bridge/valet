program.cpp
-------
Debug cloud score.
What works in Example 7:
- IAF, no cloud
- IAF, cloud
- Datum, no cloud

What doesn't work:
- Datum, cloud (equals no cloud)
- IAF, cloud on the big examples (infinite loop?)
- IAF, cloud outputs a bunch of debug info

What might work:
- Lead in the context of cloud IAF (or datum)

In tableau, don't print lead score and text tag unless requested

In tableau and in aggregate scoring table:
- Output "fair" and "luck" columns as well
- Play becomes relative to "fair", not to "Butler"

Make PrintText more modular
Fix PrintCSV (TODO tag)
