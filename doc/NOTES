program.cpp
-----------
- Cloud score not implemented for datum scoring yet

- -t now segfaults (on example7 at least)
  -d ../data/examples -n names7.txt -s scores7.txt -t tab.txt

- example7 no longer generates the right output

- is -v imps not default?

- check the colors with example7 and an example8
  in which one player is alone in her contract

In tableau and in aggregate scoring table:
- Output "fair" and "luck" columns as well
- Play becomes relative to "fair", not to "Butler"

What might work:
- Lead in the context of cloud IAF (or datum)
