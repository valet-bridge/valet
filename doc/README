This directory contains a number of documents describing or using
the Valet score in various ways.

In this directory, the Principles document is a quite complete
exposition of theory and examples.  (The spreadsheet contains two
of the tables that are included in the document itself.)

The introductory article is a short summary to whet the appetite.

The "others" directory contains articles and documents written by
others.  In particular, Thorvald Aagard has applied the Valet score
to some Danish national-team players.  Michele Cammarata has
translated the introductory article into Italian -- this was published
in the Italian bridge magazine.  Michele also wrote a somewhat
mathematical article that helped both of us to arrive a the final
mathematical formulation of the Valet score, described in the 
Appendix of the Principles document.

The "program" directory contains instructions for those who want
to use the Valet program, either directly or as a DLL.
