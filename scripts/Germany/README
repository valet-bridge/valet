These scripts can be useful as a starting point when
screen-scraping results from HTML files online.

getfiles.pl gets files according to the naming used by the website
(which you have to guess).

names.pl extracts the player names into a file of names (you have to
parse the syntax).
% perl names.pl *.html | sort | uniq > names.txt

number.pl puts consecutive numbers in front of player names, turning
that file into a valid names file.
% perl number.pl names.txt > n.txt
% mv n.txt names.txt

pairs.pl extracts pair strings.
% perl pairs.pl *.html | sort | uniq > pairs.txt

parse.pl extracts the board results using also the names files from
the previous step.
% perl parse.pl names.txt pairs.txt BL[123]*/* > scores.txt
