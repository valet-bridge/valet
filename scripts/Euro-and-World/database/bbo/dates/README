I tried three ways to get the date of play of each LIN file:

1. Using what are probably the dates at which each file was added on BBO.
   modif.pl generates files called added_20xx_xx by scraping BBO.
   These are generally close to being in order, and they are by far
   the most useful data among the attempts.  The results are in
   dates.txt and merged.xlsx

2. Recognizing actual years in the LIN text.
   years.pl generates years.txt.
   Sometimes other years appear as references in the text, so I
   output a histogram of the years in each LIN file.
   I've not checked these against #1.

3. Trying to recognize dates in the LIN text.

   a. times.pl uses a Perl library, generating times_perl
   b. dates.py uses a Python library, generating dates_python

   Both are close to useless.
   pare.pl can cut down at least a little bit on the clutter.
