- Merge the two Destroy's as well as possible
- Move Matrix to Connections/Matrix.pm or some such
- In Title, see if we can split chains such that they print easily,
  perhaps with more reductions or with post-processing
- Make a ChainStats for length and number
- Update it from Chains
- Make a Chains::print()
- In TitleBBO and TeamBBO, have an array of hashes
  - The set_hashes are called from cook.pl
  - 'TITLE_CAPTAIN' -> 'COMPONENTS_CAPTAIN'
- Have SINGLETON, AMBIGUOUS, COUNTER, ITERATOR I guess


Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Make Event same code structure as Title
Maybe this simplifies printing as well

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters

More general stuff
