Global
- TEAMS
  - ABBR: There should be one CITY, nothing else
  - Get list of clubs in city if any
    - If none, call it City Bridge Club / ...
    - If one, flag it, check manually, then fix automatically
    - If more than one, flag it
  - MEET: If consistent with TITLE, move up and delete
  - TWORD: Premier League is a valid Other team
  - ORIGIN: Not sure

In team chains
- Check CITY/CLUB/COUNTRY/LOCALITY/NATIONALITY/REGION/SPONSOR/UNI
  against Matrix
- See if we can eliminate same from TITLE
- Mark off chains that have been abstracted, maybe in the stats
  class itself (matched, unmatched)




Dynamic consistency of chains: What occurs in raw.txt

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters
