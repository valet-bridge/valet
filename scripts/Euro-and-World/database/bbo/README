ROMAN
a single 'v' (ROMAN) between TEAM1* and TEAM2*
a roman at the very end except some special cases in hash


* Do Title
* Activate KDEBUG in Knowledge.pm
* Can we limit TWORD to actual multi-purpose tournament and not
  single words?
* URL scraper
* Maybe store pdf's of URL's when available
* Syntax for Meet info
* Syntax for Tname info
* Individual tournament are version of Tname with year, ...


39011: Why still TEAM1_COUNTRY, TEAM2_COUNTRY?

10315: Then is probably Rof32, seg 2?

There are some counters 0_..., e.g. 5203

Dynamic consistency of chains: What occurs in raw.txt

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters

More general stuff
------------------

Check the .ref files that modify qx against boards, lines
(Output #lines from C++ as well?)

URL scraper from .lin
