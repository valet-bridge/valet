Scrapers:
Use dates added in cook.pl
Maybe store scraped pdf's of URL's when available?

13496: Why is Israel not picked up as a team country?
39011: Why still TEAM1_COUNTRY, TEAM2_COUNTRY?

* Activate KDEBUG in Knowledge.pm
* Can we limit TWORD to actual multi-purpose tournament and not
  single words?
* Syntax for Meet info
* Syntax for Tname info
* Individual tournament are version of Tname with year, ...

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters

More general stuff

Check the .ref files that modify qx against boards, lines
(Output #lines from C++ as well?)
