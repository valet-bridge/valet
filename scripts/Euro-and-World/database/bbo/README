What's up with > 1 STAGE?
Look for ROUND, SEGMENT, SESSION, GROUP.
Look for FORM / Scoring.

Activate KDEBUG in Knowledge.pm



For isolated N_OF_N:
Look for STAGE in TITLE, QF, SF, F
Look at SCORING being I
Look for x with x <= 8
Then it's probably a segment

39011: Why still TEAM1_COUNTRY, TEAM2_COUNTRY?

10316: Says Round 32 but is Rof32.
10315: Then is probably Rof32, seg 2?

There are some counters 0_..., e.g. 5203

Dynamic consistency of chains: What occurs in raw.txt

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters
