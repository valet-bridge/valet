Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- two team chains
- event
- scoring
- title
- use prefixes for each origin
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was i 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name



Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- DATE to DATE could become DATE_START DATE_END without 'to'
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters
