Matrix checks:
# Every city -> fixed city must have a country
# Every quarter -> quarter must have a city
# Region -> country
# University -> city
# Club -> city
# Sponsor -> country

Effectively flatten each chain: No conflict, consistent duplication
(Probably some tags occur several times and that's OK?)

Look at the Team chains for plausibility

Split on destroy
Split but don't destroy on form, gender, age
Lone numeral goes

Reductions:
- City + Abbr could be club, etc.
