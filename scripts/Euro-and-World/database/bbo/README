Some counters are ignored:
HALF
SESSION
TABLE?

When there are two, order by hierarchy, not by count

Tie break for 1D and 2D?

Also analyse the "round of" aspect in analyze.

major_fix
Should be major already
flag if not same field name

major_minor_fix
Should be 2D already
Could be two same names
Or one same, match the other
Or no same, flag

Could return an order in which to output the original list, 0 4 5 2 3 ...

Actually fix in situ in the data, but first practice

When outputting: sort on major if present, then minor if present, then bbono
