GROUP: Group is often Round-robin
1A of 11 can come apart again into Group A | 1 of 11 (just a counter,
maybe called GENERIC).
Maybe NL_N is just a bad idea to begin with.

SERIES: Can go if SERIES Series
ORG: OK as such

Global
- TEAMS
  - MEET: If consistent with TITLE, move up and delete
  - ORIGIN: Not sure

In team chains
- See if we can eliminate same from TITLE


Dynamic consistency of chains: What occurs in raw.txt

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters
