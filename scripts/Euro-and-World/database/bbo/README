Postprocess:
- Chain of length 2, COMPLETED
- The four cases from cook.pl line 300
- New category MARKER which combines a COUNTER and an ITERATOR
  - The ITERATOR goes in field (tag)
  - The value is the combined values of the two
  - Set up a set_general
  - token->merge_origin(token2)

Title:
- Clean up code in Preprocess, Postprocess
- In cook we split some more.  Do this already
- Then they should print cleanly
- Chains print should be in a new Chains (today's Chains is something
  else)

- Make a ChainStats for length and number (ignore KILLED)
- Update it from Chains
- Make a Chains::print()

- Make TeamBBO like TitleBBO (Whole)
- Move Matrix to Connections/Matrix.pm or some such

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Make Event same code structure as Title
Maybe this simplifies printing as well

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters

More general stuff
