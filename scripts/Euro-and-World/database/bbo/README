6831 Bermuda (actually OK, but also Bermuda Bowl)
6836 6851

11141 Bermuda -> BB
11142 11149 11151 11154 11155 11164 11177 11189 11192 

Some countries are really teams, including 'v'
Single country tends to be where they played,
  but Bermuda can be place or BB

Global
- TEAMS
  - MEET: If consistent with TITLE, move up and delete
  - ORIGIN: Not sure

In team chains
- See if we can eliminate same from TITLE


Dynamic consistency of chains: What occurs in raw.txt

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters
