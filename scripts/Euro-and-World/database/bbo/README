Consistent duplication
* TEAM_ABBR: Bridge Club + Sporting Club = Sporting Club (destroy one)
* Orange + Color = Netherlands + Color
* Split on destroy, form, gender, age (both before and after)
* Destroy up to two numerals
* A city in a country + Country-Pan: Destroy the Pan
* Remove temp code in check_consistency

Flatten each chain

Look at the Team chains for plausibility

Reductions:
- City + Abbr could be club, etc.
