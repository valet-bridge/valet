Event:
21194, R17 11D
Should not match 17 and 11, should match R(virtual)17(space)
as R-17, similarly for 11D

5880: 9th_9_1 should be 9 of 9, 1st weekend

Team chains should be set to complete (Team chain length stats)

Chains print should be in a new Chains (today's Chains is something else)

- Make a ChainStats for length and number (ignore KILLED)
- Update it from Chains
- Make a Chains::print()

- Make TeamBBO like TitleBBO (Whole)
- Move Matrix to Connections/Matrix.pm or some such

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Make Event same code structure as Title
Maybe this simplifies printing as well

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters

More general stuff
