Make the chapters explicit on other fields
Search not just for date but for no conflict
- then maximize positive matches, eg Final rather than no Final
When outputting a chapter, sort by the counter?
Make more chapters, e.g. Round-robin, Semi-Final, Final, Swiss

DATE_ADDED and EVENT_DATE: Consolidate
TITLE_STAGE and EVENT_STAGE sometimes don't agree (F and SF)
  Maybe title stage is elimination and can include F, SF, ...?
Have some kind of major and minor counter
Homogenize
If all rounds are "of 13", then enforce
OK to turn SESSION into SEGMENT
Better order of chapter output:
BBONO, DATE_ADDED, STAGE, counters, teams, boards
TWORD Championship can be killed
Add URLs
Store pdf's showing also player names

13496: Why is Israel not picked up as a team country?
39011: Why still TEAM1_COUNTRY, TEAM2_COUNTRY?
There are some counters 0_..., e.g. 5203

* Activate KDEBUG in Knowledge.pm
* Can we limit TWORD to actual multi-purpose tournament and not
  single words?

More general stuff

Check the .ref files that modify qx against boards, lines
(Output #lines from C++ as well?)
