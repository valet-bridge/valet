Now we have to work semantically on the studies we've created.

So maybe we keep count of the number of studies.
And we have a series of reductions.
For example, a Segment followed by (space) followed by 4
becomes a counter called Segment and a value of 4.
A counted followed by "of 4" augments the counter with that information.
A counter has a print method that prints what it knows.
Then we see how much we've explained

Make CBAI an ORGANIZER, not a COUNTRY

Make something called Region.pm with Kepri in it
