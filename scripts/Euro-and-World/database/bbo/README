Output:
Tournament
Chapter unless SINGLE
The individual ones

Hence the EntryT per tournament also has a separate chapter component

Reduce distance from 7 to eg 0 or 1


Be able to generate an EntryT from ParseT
In EntryT, be able to prune the BBO entry using the parsed entry,
leaving other fields
For a given tname+edition, store a list of BBONO
Store a large list of pruned EntryT for each BBONO
I guess only some fields in EntryT are allowed to survive
To output, loop over keys of tname+edition, then numerically in order
  over BBONO for that key

For an entry:
- Validate the central fields against the entry
  - ORGANIZATION (if present, the same)
  - COUNTRY (ditto)
  - CITY
  - ZONE
  - FORM
  - SCORING
  - GENDER
  - AGE
- The edition may have a meet
  - Must agree if given
  - Also has an ORGANIZATION, COUNTRY
  - Also has an EDITION with ORDINAL, YEAR, CITY, DATE_START, DATE_END
  - In some cases, DATEn_START, DATEn_END (give a WEEKEND as well
    centrally?)
- Are there fields in the entry that are not central?
  teams OK
  round etc OK
  More global information: what does it mean?
- Do we really lists of everything in EntryT?  Conflicts?

Scrapers:
Maybe store scraped pdf's of URL's when available?

13496: Why is Israel not picked up as a team country?
39011: Why still TEAM1_COUNTRY, TEAM2_COUNTRY?
There are some counters 0_..., e.g. 5203

* Activate KDEBUG in Knowledge.pm
* Can we limit TWORD to actual multi-purpose tournament and not
  single words?

More general stuff

Check the .ref files that modify qx against boards, lines
(Output #lines from C++ as well?)
