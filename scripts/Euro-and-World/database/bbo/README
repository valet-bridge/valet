get_sorted_order:
Maybe really sort the list in situ.

@records = sort {
    my $sum_a = 0;
    $sum_a += $_ for @{$a->{scores}};

    my $sum_b = 0;
    $sum_b += $_ for @{$b->{scores}};

    $sum_b <=> $sum_a;  # Descending order
} @records;


VERBOSE or DISCOVERY flag in RegCounter and digest, for new
countries or datasets.


Actually fix in situ in the data, but first practice

Could return an order in which to output the original list, 0 4 5 2 3 ...
When outputting: sort on major if present, then minor if present, then bbono
