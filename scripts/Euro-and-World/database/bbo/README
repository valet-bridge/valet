- Do the dash patterns
- Check any long chains remaining
- Reactivate the two patterns


7: 21
10 would work with N sep half

Singletons odd:
S
S.F.
Q
Segment (single chain)
Match

N half (end) pattern

A particle should probably be a separator?

Are AMBIGUITIES actually used?

Split Tokenize:
EventBBO?
TeamBBO?
TeamBBO splits on vs.
It should always be a list of 2.
Or it could be a chain as well to begin with.
We recognize the countries.
There are some that instead inform tournament form.

If Seg2 Oct 2004, probably split on the real space and 
not the virtual one.  Do this in general in Chains.
But Match 5B Stanza 1B would then split in lots of places...
So maybe the thing to do is to bind 1B surrounded by spaces
into a counter always.  To begin with.

DATE, LOCATION, SESSION always empty.
Scoring should be easy.

2nd Match 1st Half
ORDINAL|SEP|ITER -> ITER with counter quashed in

ITER|SEP|NUMERAL Rd 11 at end

In Cookbook, pick out the values and map to AMBIGUOUS in
the big hash already.

3. Two tokens like to combine with a binding strength 0-9
   that is specified in rules
5. An ambiguous token perhaps only merges if there is only
   one possible merge.  Only later by strength if needed.
7. Some cross-chain merges are possible, "4 (of 7)".

Maybe my chain reductions are too quick.
- If no space at all, split on dash into chains
- "10 B" becomes an unnamed COUNTER_DOUBLE.

Then there is a reduction rule
Round 7 B of 9
7 B -> generic counter_double
any counter without of + "of N" -> generic counter_double_of
any ^ iterator + generic_counter_double_of = specific_counter_double_of
So these rules can bubble up
Each reduction rule can have a score.
"of" + "8" = "of 8" binds very strongly.
2 B binds strongly as well.


Qletter, dash, Final (ITER-SEP-ITER), merge to QF
2 B (NUM-SEP-LETTER)
2:1 (NUM-SEP-NUM with colon), round and segment?


When KILL'ing, also preserve the text of the surrounding separators.

Make something called Region.pm with Kepri in it
