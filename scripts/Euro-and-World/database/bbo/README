Static consistency of Whole and Matrix

Dynamic consistency of chains

Maybe really prune Tags unused to the end?

Team chains should be set to complete (Team chain length stats).
Probably split them properly.

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters

More general stuff
