Title::Study:
AMBIGUOUS, ITERATOR should be fished out in Chains::set_general
as category, not tag.
For ITERATOR, tag becomes the capitalized value I think.
PREFIX only for book keeping, not in the actual Token.
Fix Reductions accordingly.

Title:
- Clean up code in Preprocess, Study, Postprocess (TITLE_ in one place etc)
- In cook we split some more.  Do this already
- Then they should print cleanly
- Chains print should be in a new Chains (today's Chains is something
  else)
- Have SINGLETON, AMBIGUOUS, COUNTER, ITERATOR I guess

- Make a ChainStats for length and number (ignore KILLED)
- Update it from Chains
- Make a Chains::print()

- Make TeamBBO like TitleBBO (Whole)
- Move Matrix to Connections/Matrix.pm or some such

Output all the cook results into a text file in compact format:
- a field can probably be a single or a list, { }

Make Event same code structure as Title
Maybe this simplifies printing as well

Read in that same format

Some things to do deal with:
- Unify scoring
- Teams, if present more than one time, should match, then simplify
- Years can come out
- TWORDs can be aggregated and clustered
- List of actual TNAME profiles, also ordinal guidance,
  24th was in 2013 etc, list of support points,
  locations {2013: Lisbon}, display name

Things to deal with in chains:
- ambiguous Q, O, S, Q
- Maybe eliminate/compare team names and knowledge
- Aggregate TWORD, compare against TNAME clusters

More general stuff
