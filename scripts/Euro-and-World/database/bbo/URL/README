Here I extract URI's from the text of the LIN files.
It works well as such, but people put all kinds of stuff in the chat.

1. url.py can do it with or without the scheme (https:// for example).
   It is currently set to use URI::Find::Schemeless.

2. url.py is schemeless.

In order to cut down on the clutter, I've started on pare.pl.
This is work in progress.  Maybe I want to download pdf's of result
pages, including from the Wayback Machine.
For that I might want wkhtmltopdf 
pip install pdfkit

import pdfkit

# Specify the URL of the web page you want to download
url = 'https://www.example.com'

# Specify the output file name
output_pdf = 'output.pdf'

# Download the web page and save it as a PDF
pdfkit.from_url(url, output_pdf)

print(f'Web page saved as {output_pdf}')
