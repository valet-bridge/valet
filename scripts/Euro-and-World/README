These scripts can be useful as a starting point when
screen-scraping results from HTML files online.

perl getfiles.pl 592
gets the round and match files.  The number has to be integrated
within Tourneys.pm which knows the URL's, directory names, round 
counts etc.

perl names.pl path/*.asp > names0.txt
sort names0.txt | uniq > names1.txt
perl number.pl names1.txt > path/names.txt
rm names0.txt names1.txt
generates a numbered file of player names.

perl parse.pl path/names.txt path/*.asp > scores0.txt
sort -n !$ > path/scores.txt
rm scores0.txt
generates a score file using the names file.

perl getdist.pl 592
generates a Hands directory and downloads the hands.
For this step, the scores.txt file has to be in the directory.

mkdir path/PBN (the script doesn't create this automatically)
perl parsedist.pl directory-path
fills out the PBN directory

Then depending on the complexity of the tournament:

- If all (Men, Women, Seniors, Mixed) play the same boards in the
  same round numbers:  We can parse all of them in one go.
  We can use the PBN of one of the sections.

- If not, we have to use a map.txt file which renumbers rounds and
  score entries.  If one section has both a round-robin and a final,
  for example, these are combined.  The sections can also be combined.

perl checkmap.pl directory-path
checks that the PBN boards are the same in those sections and rounds
that are supposed to be the same according to map.txt.  It does not
modify anything.

perl mergemap.pl directory-path
makes an integrated scores.txt file with the new round names,
as well as an integrated PBN directory (which must also be created
manually first).
