These scripts can be useful as a starting point when
screen-scraping results from HTML files online.

getfiles.pl gets files according to the naming used by the website
(which you have to guess).

names.pl extracts the player names into a file of names(you have to
parse the syntax).

number.pl puts consecutive numbers in front of player names, turning
that file into a valid names file.

parse.pl extracts the board results using also the names files from
the previous step.
