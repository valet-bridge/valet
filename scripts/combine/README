These scripts can be useful when turning individual IAF or datum files
(in CSV format) into an overall CSV file.

edit.pl capitalizes the last name if that's not already the case
(we just look at the first word of each player to determine this),
and swaps the player names around if necessary (so that the first
name is lexigraphically smaller than the second one), 

merge.pl combines data for the same pair into a single entry.
